Adapted from the WordPress Twenty Twelve Theme

Sliders and Tabs use Bx Slider

Photo Galleries and Single Images Use Osvaldas Responsive Gallery Script

The responsive Menu uses slick nav.

A copy of the parent theme can be worded on and experimented on PhilaDirectory.com.  Don’t assume the latest version is on there though.
